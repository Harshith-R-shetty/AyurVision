Overuse, Underuse, and Wrong Use of the Senses

Our senses offer pleasure and essential information. However, improper use can lead to imbalances and illnesses. Overuse of senses strains the nervous system, while misuse can result in damage. Underuse, on the other hand, involves not fully utilizing our senses, which can have negative consequences.

Examples of Misuse

Repeated exposure to bright light can harm the eyes and trigger pitta imbalances.

Listening to loud sounds can damage the hearing apparatus and affect vata dosha.

Misusing the taste organ by consuming inappropriate foods can lead to imbalances.

Exposing senses to wrong inputs like violent movies can also be harmful.

Examples of Underuse

Not perceiving with full attention can lead to accidents.

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can result from insufficient sunlight exposure.

Prolonged sensory deprivation, like staying indoors for long periods, can cause discomfort.

Ayurveda and Self-Knowledge

Very often we get sick because we disregard our own knowledge or wisdom. Understanding our prakruti, our psychobiological constitution, is self-knowledge; understanding how certain foods can disturb the balance of our mind-body system and lead to illness is crucial. By following the principles of Ayurveda and paying attention to our intuition, we can regulate our lives in harmony with universal intelligence.

Relationships and Health

Our life is all about relationships, with nature, with others, and with ourselves. Negative emotions in relationships can lead to stress, disrupting our inner balance and causing illness. Clarity in relationships fosters compassion and love, which are essential for successful relationships.
