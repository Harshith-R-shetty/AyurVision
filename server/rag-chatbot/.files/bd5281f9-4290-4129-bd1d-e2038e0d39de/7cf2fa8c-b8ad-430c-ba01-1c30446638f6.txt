This biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and evening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the influence of vata is greatest. In the early morning, from about 2 A.M. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken and tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 P.M. until sunset, the influence of vata makes one feel light and active.

Early morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 A.M., kapha makes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 P.M. until around 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.

Midday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into pitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 P.M. until around 2 A.M., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.

Thus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:

6 A.M.–10 A.M. = kapha

10 A.M.–2 P.M. = pitta

2 P.M.–6 P.M. = vata

6 P.M.–10 P.M. = kapha

10 P.M.–2 A.M. = pitta

Wake Up Early

It is beneficial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure qualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and peace of mind. Ideally, vata people should get up at about 6 A.M., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha people by 4:30. Right after awakening, look at your hands for a few moments, then gently move them over your face, neck, and chest down to your waist for more alertness.

Say a Prayer

Start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You may do this in your own way or use a simple prayer like:

Dear God, you are inside of me

Within my very breath

Within each bird, each mighty mountain.

Your sweet touch reaches everything

and I am well protected.

Thank you God for this beautiful day before me.

May joy, love, peace, and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day.
