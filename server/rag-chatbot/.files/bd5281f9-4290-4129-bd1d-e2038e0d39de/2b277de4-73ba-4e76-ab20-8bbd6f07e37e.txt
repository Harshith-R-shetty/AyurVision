Dealing with Stress

Stress is a psychosomatic disorder with various causes in our daily lives. It can lead to allergies, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and even heart conditions. Different doshas may react differently to stress based on individual constitution.

Vata Individuals

Vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions like anxiety or fearfulness. They may experience phobias or anxiety neurosis.

Pitta Individuals

Pitta individuals may see an increase in pitta during stressful situations, leading to reactions like anger. They may also suffer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other pitta disorders.

Kapha Individuals

Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function, slow metabolism, and increased blood sugar. They may tend to overeat and gain weight.

Relaxation Techniques

To prevent stress buildup, stay calm during potentially stressful situations. Deep breathing, massage, positive imagery, prayer, chanting, meditation, and yoga can help alleviate stress.

Managing Stress

Analyze your stressors and categorize them into things you can control and things you can't. Take action on what you can change and learn to accept and surrender to situations beyond your control for inner peace.
